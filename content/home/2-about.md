title: 'Welcome to Maintainer Month!'
theme1: "This year, we're focusing on the critical role maintainers play in securing the digital infrastructure we all depend on. Join us in recognizing their efforts and supporting a more secure open source ecosystem."
theme2: 'Maintainers keep the software ecosystem running, but theyâ€™re humans, not machines. Do you know who the maintainers you rely on are? Do you know what kind of support those individuals actually need? Ask what you can do for them, and be ready to listen.'

Open source runs the world, but who runs open source? Open source maintainers are behind the software we use everyday, but they don't always have the community or support they need. That's why we're celebrating open source maintainers during the month of May.

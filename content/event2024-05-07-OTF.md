Join GitHub and the Open Technology Fund (OTF) for a conversation on open source sustainability, and how the OTF’s new FOSS Sustainability Fund opens up new avenues for open source funding.

Tune in for a fireside chat with Felix Reda, GitHub’s Director of Developer Policy and former member of the European Parliament, Laura Cunningham, President of OTF and former Senior Advisor for Internet Freedom in the U.S. State Department, and Susan Kennedy, Program Manager at OTF. Their discussion will include policy, internet freedoms, private versus public funding, the implications of the xz Utils vulnerability, FOSS maintainer health and burnout, and more.

With the applications for the inaugural fund open through May 17th, this is a unique chance to learn more about the application process, what the grants look like, and how funding free and open source software is crucial for the security, privacy, and sustainability of online access.

Join GitHub for Open Source Friday: a weekly celebration of open source projects, brought to you by the folks building them. 

On May 10th, Kedasha Kerr and Andrea Griffiths will be talking with the maintainers of [Bloom](https://github.com/chaynHQ/bloom-frontend). Bloom is a free, web-based, remote trauma support service from Chayn, a global charity supporting survivors of abuse across borders.

[Sign up on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/github/) for a reminder, and tune in on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/github).

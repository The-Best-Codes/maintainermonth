Join GitHub for Open Source Friday: a weekly celebration of open source projects, brought to you by the folks building them. 
On May 24th, [Marlin](github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) maintainer @thinkyhead will be joining hosts Kedasha Kerr and Andrea Griffiths. Marlin is an optimized firmware for RepRap 3D printers based on the Arduino platform.  [Sign up on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/github/) for a reminder, and tune in on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/github).

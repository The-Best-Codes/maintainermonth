Last year, GitHub set off to understand ways to advance diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) within open source. We captured 7,000+ voices in the 2021 Open Source DEI Survey and heard from 300 community members during the Maintainers Listening Tour. We listened, learned, and now we are launching All In for Maintainers, a comprehensive initiative that seeks to provide maintainers with the training and technical support they need to support them along their communityâ€™s DEI journey. 

- Come join Demetris Cheatham, the Senior Director for Diversity and Inclusion Strategy at GitHub to to learn about The DEI Resource Hub; 
- The All In CHAOSS Project Badging Initiative; and
- The All In Collaboration and Community Hub. 

We are building these initiatives with maintainers, not for maintainers, so we also want to hear from you!

Throughout the month, Open Source Initiative (OSI) and affiliates will be highlighting maintainers who prioritize security in their projects, sharing their stories, and providing a platform for collaboration and learning.

As part of the programming for May, OSI will host a virtual Town Hall alongside affiliate organizations and invite the broader Open Source community to join. The Town Hall will offer a space to discuss how we can support maintainers, foster secure development practices, and share resources across geographies and sectors.

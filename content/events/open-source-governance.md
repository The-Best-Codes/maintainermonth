When most people hear the word “governance” they think of formal documents like bylaws and big questions like “who calls the shots?” But governance is a part of every project's day to day functioning - and, as with many unacknowledged dependencies, most people only notice when there’s a critical bug. This workshop will introduce a basic framework for thinking about governance and will dive into some of the most common "governance bugs" open source projects face, including cultivating leaders from the community, collective technical decision-making, and formalizing and/or transitioning a governance structure.

Workshop registration is available in the private Maintainer Community. Request an invitation here: [maintainers.github.com](https://maintainers.github.com)

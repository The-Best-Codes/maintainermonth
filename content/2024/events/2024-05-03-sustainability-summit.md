As the impacts of climate change mount, it is essential that we all work together to decarbonize energy and transportation systems, which are among the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. A collaborative approach involving all stakeholders is necessary to develop the technologies needed to speed the transition to renewable energy sources in a fair and inclusive manner.

This event will gather lawmakers, policymakers, electrical utility companies, auto makers, technology vendors, researchers, and end users of energy to discuss the challenges and opportunities for an open source model of building both technology and standards to drive the energy transition, with particular focus on how policy and regulation can support this collaborative approach and ensure communities are diverse and inclusive.

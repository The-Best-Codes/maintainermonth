# Welcome to Maintainer Month!

...a month for open source maintainers to gather, share, and be celebrated.
Open source runs the world, but who runs open source? Open source maintainers are behind the software we use everyday, but they don't always have the community or support they need. That's why we're celebrating open source maintainers all month long.

The 2024 Maintainer Month is, of course, in **May**! You're invited to participate in whatever ways you'd like. 

## Themes for 2024

**Theme For Maintainers**
TBD for this year pending Advisory Committee recommendations. 2023's theme was 'Finding balance, stepping back, and succession planning as leaders.'

**Theme For Companies**
TBD for this year pending Advisory Committee recommendations. 2023's theme was 'Now is the time to double down on funding open source.'

## How To Get Involved
Maintainer Month is an open source project — anyone can jump in and contribute! Whether you're a maintainer, an organization, or a fan or open source, you're invited to participate! Here are a few ways you can jump in:
